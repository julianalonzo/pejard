                    <h2>About the journal</h2>

                    <p>The Philippine e-Journal for Applied Research and Development (PeJARD) caters to
                    applied research outputs that have bearings on real-world problems affecting
                    communities, sectors, and institutions across the country. It functions as a
                    nationwide forum for disseminating and discussing studies that address local
                    problems and issues, with the end in view of contributing towards local and
                    national development.</p>

                    <p>The PeJARD is a peer-reviewed, online, and open access journal that comes out in
                    annual volumes. It is a not-for-profit publication, hence it does not charge access
                    fees to readers nor publication fees to authors. Moreover, it publishes articles under
                    the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution
                    license (CC BY)</a>, giving authors copyright ownership of their own works while allowing
                    the public free use and distribution of journal articles as long as the authors
                    and the journal are properly credited.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
    				<h2>Rationale and objectives</h2>

    				<p>Applied researches on local problems and issues are not wanting in the country.
    				However, the outputs are scattered in journals published independently by disciplinal
    				associations or by individual colleges and universities, with their reach generally
    				confined within these associations and institutions themselves. This situation does
    				not lend itself towards the maximum dissemination and utilization of available
    				applied research outputs. Neither does it facilitate inter-local and inter-disciplinal
    				exchange among applied research practitioners, notwithstanding that local problems
    				and issues often span geographical settings and disciplinal expertises.</p>

    				<p>The Philippine e-Journal for Applied Research and Development aims to address
    				these limitations by offering a common, one-stop platform for applied researches from
    				across disciplines and higher education institutions all over the archipelago. This
    				goal is abetted immensely by the fact that the Journal is online and in open access
    				mode, thus freely and fully accessible to all interested parties anytime and anywhere
    				in the country. In addition, being purely electronic and non-commercial, the PeJARD
    				sets no limit on the number of articles in its volumes, hence allowing for the
    				publication of as many candidate materials.</p>
    			</section>

    			<section>
    				<h2>Scope and areas of interest</h2>

    				<p>The Journal welcomes applied research outputs from across disciplines insofar as
    				these offer new insights or solutions to everyday problems and issues. But while
    				research manuscripts emanate from specific disciplines, their findings should be
    				of relevance and interest to the wider public rather than just to specialists in
    				the discipline. Manuscripts that speak more to the latter should be channeled to
    				specialized disciplinal journals instead.</p>

    				<p>The problems and issues addressed by the target manuscripts may be located in the
    				socio-cultural, economic, political, educational, health, and environmental domains.
    				Specific areas may fall under, but are not limited to the following: public welfare,
    				quality of life and well-being, livelihood, delivery of social services, access to health,
    				cooperative work, community initiatives, urban planning, environmental protection,
    				climate change mitigation, disaster readiness and rehabilitation, peace and order,
    				sanitation, sustainable energy, public works monitoring, workers’ welfare and industrial
    				relations, farmers’ and fisherfolks’ issues, inclusive education, public education, HEI
    				extension programs, human rights and legal system, inter-ethnic and inter-faith relations,
    				family welfare, and responsible parenthood.</p>
    			</section>

    			<section>
    				<h2>Target audience</h2>

    				<ul>
    					<li>Policy makers and public planners, including LGUs and state agencies</li>
    					<li>NGOs, POs, civic organizations, and development workers</li>
    					<li>HEI faculty researchers and extensionists</li>
    					<li>Private company CSR officers and personnel</li>
    					<li>Civic-minded citizens</li>
    				</ul>
    			</section>

    			<section>
    				<h2>Submission and processing of manuscripts</h2>

    				<p>Submission of manuscripts is year-round, with individual manuscripts being processed
    				as they come. Once a candidate manuscript successfully hurdles the peer-review process,
    				it gets published immediately and independently of other articles. As an online and a
    				not-for-profit periodical, the PeJARD is not bound by any limitation on the number of
    				articles to publish nor by a certain timetable for accepting and publishing materials.</p>
    			</section>

    			<section>
    				<h2>Quality assurance and equity</h2>

    				<p>The Journal is refereed, with a pool of highly qualified reviewers from reputable
    				institutions of higher learning and agencies. Moreover, these peer-reviewers are
    				well-selected, taking into account disciplinal expertise, geographic location,
    				institutional affiliation, and gender.</p>
