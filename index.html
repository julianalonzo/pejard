					<h2>About the journal</h2>

					<p>The Philippine e-Journal for Applied Research and Development (PeJARD) caters to 
					applied research outputs that have bearings on real-world problems affecting 
					communities, sectors, and institutions across the country. It functions as a 
					nationwide forum for disseminating and discussing studies that address local 
					problems and issues, with the end in view of contributing towards local and 
					national development.</p>

					<p>The PeJARD is a peer-reviewed, online, and open access journal that comes out in 
					annual volumes. It is a not-for-profit publication, hence it does not charge access 
					fees to readers nor publication fees to authors. Moreover, it publishes articles under 
					the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 
					license (CC BY)</a>, giving authors copyright ownership of their own works while allowing 
					the public free use and distribution of journal articles as long as the authors 
					and the journal are properly credited.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Rationale and objectives</h2>

					<p>Applied researches on local problems and issues are not wanting in the country. 
					However, the outputs are scattered in journals published independently by disciplinal 
					associations or by individual colleges and universities, with their reach generally 
					confined within these associations and institutions themselves. This situation does 
					not lend itself towards the maximum dissemination and utilization of available 
					applied research outputs. Neither does it facilitate inter-local and inter-disciplinal 
					exchange among applied research practitioners, notwithstanding that local problems 
					and issues often span geographical settings and disciplinal expertises.</p>

					<p>The Philippine e-Journal for Applied Research and Development aims to address 
					these limitations by offering a common, one-stop platform for applied researches from 
					across disciplines and higher education institutions all over the archipelago. This 
					goal is abetted immensely by the fact that the Journal is online and in open access 
					mode, thus freely and fully accessible to all interested parties anytime and anywhere 
					in the country. In addition, being purely electronic and non-commercial, the PeJARD 
					sets no limit on the number of articles in its volumes, hence allowing for the 
					publication of as many candidate materials.</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Scope and areas of interest</h2>

					<p>The Journal welcomes applied research outputs from across disciplines insofar as 
					these offer new insights or solutions to everyday problems and issues. But while 
					research manuscripts emanate from specific disciplines, their findings should be 
					of relevance and interest to the wider public rather than just to specialists in 
					the discipline. Manuscripts that speak more to the latter should be channeled to 
					specialized disciplinal journals instead.</p>

					<p>The problems and issues addressed by the target manuscripts may be located in the 
					socio-cultural, economic, political, educational, health, and environmental domains. 
					Specific areas may fall under, but are not limited to the following: public welfare, 
					quality of life and well-being, livelihood, delivery of social services, access to health, 
					cooperative work, community initiatives, urban planning, environmental protection, 
					climate change mitigation, disaster readiness and rehabilitation, peace and order, 
					sanitation, sustainable energy, public works monitoring, workers’ welfare and industrial 
					relations, farmers’ and fisherfolks’ issues, inclusive education, public education, HEI 
					extension programs, human rights and legal system, inter-ethnic and inter-faith relations, 
					family welfare, and responsible parenthood.</p>

					<h2>Submission and processing of manuscripts</h2>

					<p>Submission of manuscripts is year-round, with individual manuscripts being processed 
					as they come. Once a candidate manuscript successfully hurdles the peer-review process, 
					it gets published immediately and independently of other articles. As an online and a 
					not-for-profit periodical, the PeJARD is not bound by any limitation on the number of 
					articles to publish nor by a certain timetable for accepting and publishing materials.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Quality assurance and equity</h2>

					<p>The Journal is refereed, with a pool of highly qualified reviewers from reputable 
					institutions of higher learning and agencies. Moreover, these peer-reviewers are 
					well-selected, taking into account disciplinal expertise, geographic location, 
					institutional affiliation, and gender.</p>
