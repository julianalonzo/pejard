                                        <li>Research articles should include the sections common to journal manuscripts: 
                                            Title, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Results/Findings, Discussion, Conclusion, 
                                            Acknowledgments (if any), and References. However, as the Journal caters to a wide 
                                            array of disciplines, variations may be introduced according to disciplinal 
                                            conventions. [Those looking for detailed guidelines may request for ‘Elements 
                                            of a journal article: Writing Guide’ from the

                                        <li>The Abstract should not exceed 150 words, and the Keywords, not more than 
                                            ten substantive words.</li>

                                        <li>Tables and figures should be inserted within the text itself rather than 
                                            appended to the manuscript.</li>

                                        <li>The names of the authors, including their institutional affiliations and 
                                            contact numbers, should not be indicated anywhere in the manuscript. These 
                                            should appear instead on the Cover Page and only on this page.</li>

                                        <li>The text for submission should be in a single column rather than the 
                                            two-column format of the PeJARD articles. The final formatting will be 
                                            done by the Journal only after the review process.</li>

                                        <li>The Journal does not prescribe any particular reference style as the 
                                            manuscripts are expected from across disciplines. Contributors should use 
                                            the format commonly practiced in their own disciplines so long as consistency 
                                            is observed throughout the manuscript.</li>

                                <li>Manuscripts shall go through double-blind review, with at least two reviewers assessing each manuscript.</li>
                                <li>The Editor communicates the review results and details to the individual contributors. 
                                    The latter does the suggested revisions, if any. S/he may also choose to rebut the assessment 
                                    done by the reviewers. In the latter case, the Editor decides whether to accept the article 
                                    as is, reject it, or refer it to a new set of reviewers.</li>
                                <li>The review process shall be conducted in full confidentiality. The reviewers are bound not 
                                    to discuss and divulge anything about the manuscripts under review except with the Editor. 
                                    The authors shall also keep confidential all communications from the Journal pertaining to 
                                    the review process.</li>
                                <li>The Editor does the final choice as to what articles will be published, depending on the 
                                    recommendations of the reviewers as well as his/her own assessments.</li>
                                <li>Authors may consider sending their manuscripts to other journals only after they would 
                                    have received a notice of rejection from the Editor. They can also withdraw the manuscript 
                                    anytime during the review, through formal communication addressed to the Editor. Withdrawal 
                                    of manuscript would take effect after the Editor grants the request, also in writing.</li>
